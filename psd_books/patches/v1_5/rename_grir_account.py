"""
Patch v1_5: rename the GR/IR clearing account's display name from
"Stock Received But Not Billed" to "Stock Received" for every company.

Only the account_name / doc name (autoname "{account_name} - {company}")
changes. account_type stays "Stock Received But Not Billed" — that's a
fixed Select option baked into accounts/doctype/account/account.json and
is read by GL posting logic (accounts/inventory_gl.py GRIR_ACCOUNT_TYPE),
the balance sheet report, and Books Company account-type validation, so it
is left untouched. Renaming the Account doc automatically updates every
Link reference (Books Company.stock_received_not_billed, GL Entry rows,
etc.) via frappe.rename_doc.

Non-destructive and idempotent.
