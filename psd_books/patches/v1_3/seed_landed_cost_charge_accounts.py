"""
Patch v1_3: back-fill the three Landed Cost Voucher charge accounts
(Freight & Parcel Charges - Inward, Local Transport Charges - Inward,
Freight & Courier Charges - Outward) for every EXISTING company.

Background:
    _seed_coa()'s COA list now includes these three accounts, so any NEW
    company created after this patch gets them automatically via
    bootstrap_company_data(). Companies that already existed before this
    change (e.g. VK Herbal) never ran that seeding step for these rows, so
    this patch runs the same idempotent insert logic against every company
    already in the system.

Non-destructive and idempotent: only inserts accounts that don't already
exist (checked by full account name "{account_name} - {company}"); never
renames or deletes anything. Safe to re-run.
