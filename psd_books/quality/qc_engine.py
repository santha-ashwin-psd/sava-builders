QC Engine — psd_books.quality.qc_engine
===============================================
The 4th cross-cutting middleware layer (alongside _CV, _SL, _TN).

Wired via hooks.py doc_events to 7 doctypes on on_submit/before_submit,
and MUST run BEFORE _SL (stock_link) so QC state is known before stock moves.

Design:
  - Soft-warn mode  (default): msgprint, never raises
  - Hard-block mode (opt-in via Books Settings qc_hard_block=1): frappe.throw() blocks submit
  - QC coverage is tracked per reference-doc ROW (via each row's own
    `quality_inspection` Link, stamped at creation time), not just per
    item code — so two rows of the same item (different batches, a split
    receipt) are each independently gated rather than one row's passed
    inspection silently covering the other.
