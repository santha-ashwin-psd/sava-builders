QC Hold Manager — psd_books.quality.qc_hold_manager
===========================================================
Manages the quarantine / QC hold lifecycle for items that fail QC Inspection,
and (Phase 3) the release lifecycle for items that were pre-emptively
quarantined at receipt and then pass.

Two distinct quarantine paths now feed into this module:

  A) Phase 2 pre-emptive quarantine: stock_link._maybe_route_to_quarantine()
     routes a QC-flagged row straight into the company's quarantine
     warehouse AT RECEIPT, before any inspection verdict exists. That
     function stamps the row's QC Inspection with release_status=
     "Not Released" and quarantine_warehouse at routing time, and
     qc_engine.py's before_submit hook separately stamps target_warehouse
     (the row's original, pre-quarantine intended destination) — both
     BEFORE this module ever runs.

  B) The legacy Fail-triggered path (place_on_hold, still used for
     reference doctypes Phase 2 doesn't yet cover — Stock Entry
     Manufacture, Delivery Note, Sales Invoice): stock sits in its normal
     warehouse until a QC Inspection actually fails, at which point THIS
     module moves it into quarantine for the first time.

handle_qc_result (on_submit of QC Inspection) now branches three ways:
  - status == "Pass": if path (A) applies (release_status == "Not
    Released"), auto-creates a release Stock Entry moving stock from
    quarantine_warehouse to target_warehouse (Phase 3's
    _release_quarantine_on_pass), gated by
    Books Company.qc_auto_release_on_pass (default on). A no-op for any
    row that was never quarantined.
  - status == "Fail", path (A) already applied: stock is already sitting in
    quarantine — this just stamps the hold flags (qc_hold, hold_reason) so
    it surfaces in get_quarantine_summary() like any other hold, WITHOUT
    creating a second quarantine Stock Entry (which would otherwise try to
    move stock from the quarantine warehouse to itself).
  - status == "Fail", path (A) doesn't apply: unchanged legacy behaviour —
    place_on_hold() creates the first quarantine Stock Entry from the
    row's current (normal) warehouse.

handle_qc_cancel (on_cancel) mirrors this: reverses whichever of the above
actually happened — the release Stock Entry for a cancelled Pass, or the
quarantine Stock Entry + hold flags for a cancelled Fail (only when this
module was the one that moved the stock, i.e. path B; path A's stock
placement is stock_link.py's concern, not reversed here).

When a QC Inspection is submitted with status=Fail (path B only), this
module:
  1. Flags the hold on the QC Inspection itself (qc_hold=1) — this is the
     authoritative, batch-scoped record of the hold (a QC Inspection is
     always scoped to one reference_name/item/batch_no).
  2. Optionally creates a Stock Entry to transfer stock to a quarantine warehouse
  3. Recomputes Item.qc_hold as a derived roll-up: true if ANY batch of that
     item currently has an active hold. This roll-up is a convenience flag
     for list views/reports only — it is never the source of truth, so
     placing/releasing a hold on one batch never affects other batches of
     the same item.

When a QC Inspection is cancelled (status was Fail), handle_qc_cancel
reverses everything the above set up: cancels the quarantine Stock Entry,
voids any still-Pending QC Approval Request, clears this inspection's own
hold flag, and recomputes the Item-level roll-up.

When QC Hold is released:
  - Disposition = "Release to Stock"   -> Stock Entry: quarantine -> target warehouse
  - Disposition = "Scrap"              -> Stock Entry (Material Issue): written off from quarantine
  - Disposition = "Return to Supplier" -> Stock Entry: quarantine -> target (returns/outbound staging) warehouse
Every disposition requires the exact quantity that was quarantined for that
specific QC Inspection (never a warehouse-wide balance), so releasing one
batch never touches stock belonging to a different batch still on hold in
the same quarantine warehouse.

    Called on_cancel of QC Inspection.

    status == "Pass": reverses whatever _release_quarantine_on_pass did --
    cancels the release Stock Entry (if still submitted) and resets
    release_status back to "Not Released", so the row is once again
    correctly reflected as sitting in quarantine awaiting a fresh
    inspection. A no-op if this Pass never triggered a release (item was
    never quarantined, toggle was off, or the release failed).

    status == "Fail": reverses everything handle_qc_result / place_on_hold
    set up:
      1. Cancels the auto-created quarantine Stock Entry, if it's still
         submitted (only when this inspection's hold is still active —
         i.e. it was never released, so nothing has moved out of quarantine yet).
         Skipped when this row was already quarantined at receipt (Phase 2) --
         handle_qc_result never created a second quarantine Stock Entry for
         that case, so there is nothing of THIS inspection's to reverse; the
         stock's presence in quarantine is stock_link.py's concern, not this
         inspection's.
      2. Clears this inspection's own qc_hold flag and recomputes the
         item-level roll-up flag (other batches of the same item may still
         legitimately be on hold).
      3. Voids the auto-created QC Approval Request if it's still Pending —
         no QA decision was ever made, so it's cancelled rather than rejected.
    Every step is best-effort and non-fatal: a QC Inspection must always be
    cancellable even if some downstream cleanup fails; failures are logged
    instead of blocking the cancel.
