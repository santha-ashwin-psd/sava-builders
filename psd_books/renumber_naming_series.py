"""
Renumber documents that use a Frappe naming series (e.g. INV-2026-00009 -> INV-2026-00001)
so that existing records become sequential starting at 1, with no gaps, and the
Series counter is reset so the NEXT new document continues correctly after the last one.

HOW TO RUN
----------
Copy this file into your bench apps folder (or anywhere bench can import it) and run:

    bench --site your-site-name console

Then inside the console:

    from renumber_naming_series import renumber
    renumber("Sales Invoice", prefix="INV-2026-", padding=5)

Or run directly as a script:

    bench --site your-site-name execute renumber_naming_series.renumber \
        --kwargs "{'doctype':'Sales Invoice','prefix':'INV-2026-','padding':5}"

WHAT IT DOES
------------
1. Fetches all docs of the given doctype whose `name` starts with `prefix`,
   ordered by creation (oldest first) - so the oldest record becomes 00001,
   next becomes 00002, and so on, with zero gaps.
2. Uses frappe.rename_doc() for each one, which also fixes up every Link/Dynamic
   Link field pointing to that document across the whole site (child tables,
   references, GL Entries, etc.) - not just a raw SQL update.
3. Updates the `tabSeries` counter row for that prefix so the *next* auto-generated
   name continues correctly from the last renumbered record (avoids collisions).

IMPORTANT NOTES
----------------
- BACK UP YOUR DATABASE before running this (bench --site your-site backup).
- Run this when no one else is using the system / during low traffic, since
  renaming documents can briefly lock rows.
- If two docs would end up mapped to names that already exist and aren't part
  of the batch, rename_doc will raise - the script uses a temporary "__tmp__"
  prefix pass first to avoid collisions between old and new numbers.
- `padding` must match the ##### count in your naming series (5 hashes = 5 here).
- Works for any doctype using a simple prefix + zero-padded running number series
  (Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice, Quotation, Sales Order, Credit Note, etc.)
