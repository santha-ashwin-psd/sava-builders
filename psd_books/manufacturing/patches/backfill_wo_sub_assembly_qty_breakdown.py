"""One-off patch: backfill sub_assembly_qty_breakdown on existing Work Order
Item rows saved before that field existed.

Does NOT touch required_qty, amount, rate, or sub_assembly_boms on any row --
only fills in the new sub_assembly_qty_breakdown field, purely so
WorkOrder.vue's groupedWoItems can show each sub-assembly's correct portion
of a shared row instead of lumping it into "Shared / Multiple Sub-Assemblies".

For each Work Order that has a bom + qty, re-explodes that BOM (same
_explode_bom_items + _merge_duplicate_rows path used when materials are
loaded fresh) to recompute what the per-origin qty split SHOULD be, then
matches those freshly-exploded rows back onto the Work Order's existing
saved rows -- by (item_code, source_warehouse) first, falling back to
item_code alone if the row's warehouse was hand-edited since -- and stamps
only the breakdown field.

Run:
    bench --site <sitename> execute \
        psd_books.manufacturing.patches.backfill_wo_sub_assembly_qty_breakdown.execute

Safe to re-run -- rows that already have breakdown data are skipped, and a
Work Order whose BOM was since cancelled/deleted or whose ratio can't be
recomputed is skipped with a note, not failed.
