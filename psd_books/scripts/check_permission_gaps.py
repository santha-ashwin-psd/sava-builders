"""
Permission-gap lint: flags @frappe.whitelist() functions in api/*.py that
look like they mutate data (call .insert/.save/.submit/.cancel/db_set/
set_value/delete/rename_doc/etc.) but never call one of the module/action
guards from utils/access.py.

This is a static heuristic, not a permission engine -- it can't see what a
called helper function does, so:
  - False negatives are possible (a guard called only inside a shared helper
    won't be seen). Endpoints that already delegate to a guarded helper are
    fine even if this script still lists them; check by hand.
  - False positives are expected for genuinely guest/pre-membership flows
    (signup, password reset, OTP) -- list them in ALLOWLIST below with a
    one-line reason instead of adding an inline guard that wouldn't make
    sense pre-authentication.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_permission_gaps.py          # human-readable report
    python scripts/check_permission_gaps.py --ci      # exit 1 if any
                                                          non-allowlisted gap found

Run from the app root (psd_books/).
