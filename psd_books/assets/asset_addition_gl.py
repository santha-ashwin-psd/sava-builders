"""
Asset Addition — Phase 4 of the "self-contained fixed-asset lifecycle"
build-out. Covers replacing damaged/lost/stolen units with new ones,
either paid (a real purchase) or free (warranty/insurance honored in
kind, supplier goodwill).

Design decision (locked in chat before this was built): a replacement
does NOT blend qty/cost onto the original Asset record. It spins off a
brand-new Asset record with its own depreciation schedule, linked back
via Asset.replacement_of. Rationale: the replacement units were very
likely acquired on a different date, at a different cost, and the
original Asset's depreciation schedule may already be partway through
its life (or fully depreciated) -- forcing a blended average cost onto
that existing schedule would require re-deriving it mid-flight (exactly
the kind of live-schedule surgery this app deliberately defers -- see
depreciation_engine.py / asset_gl.py headers). A fresh Asset record with
its own clean schedule sidesteps all of that, at the cost of the asset
register showing the replacement as a separate line rather than a
qty bump on the original. Asset.replacement_of is the audit trail that
ties them back together.

This module does NOT duplicate the capitalization/tax GL logic that
already lives in asset_gl.py -- it reuses it wholesale by constructing a
real, ordinary Asset document and calling .insert()/.submit() on it:

  Paid Replacement:
    is_existing_asset = 0, taxable_value/taxes/credit_account carried
    over from this doc. Asset.calculate_totals() and
    asset_gl.post_asset_capitalization() run exactly as they would for
    any other new Asset purchase -- same ITC-eligible/blocked-credit tax
    split, same DR Fixed Asset (or CWIP) / CR Credit Account posting,
    same account validation and error messages. Nothing about that path
    is re-implemented here.

  Free Replacement (Warranty/Insurance):
    is_existing_asset = 1, purchase_cost/taxable_value = 0. This flag
    already means "not capitalized through this app's own GL" for every
    other module (asset_gl, asset_disposal_gl, depreciation_posting) --
    it's a natural fit for "zero GL impact, just restore qty", not a
    repurposing of the flag's meaning. A zero-cost asset also can't
    build a depreciation schedule (depreciation_engine.build_schedule
    requires cost > 0), which is correct: there's no cost basis to
    depreciate.

Asset Addition's own "posting" is therefore just orchestration: create
the child Asset, submit it, record the link both ways. Reversal on
cancel is a real document cancel of that child Asset (not a GL-entry
reversal like the other modules), and is deliberately NOT best-effort --
if the replacement Asset has already had depreciation posted or been
disposed, the Addition refuses to cancel rather than leaving orphaned
state.
