"""
Asset depreciation engine — Phase 3 of the asset-management accounting
build-out.

Replaces the old always-straight-line, always-annual, never-pro-rated
schedule generator that lived inline in Asset.generate_depreciation_schedule.
This module only *calculates* a schedule (list of dicts); it never touches
the database or the GL — see assets/depreciation_posting.py for that.

Design notes / deliberate scope limits (documented rather than silently
approximated):

  - Written Down Value (WDV) rate: derived from cost, salvage_value and
    useful_life via the standard reducing-balance formula
        rate = 1 - (salvage / cost) ** (1 / life_years)
    WDV mathematically never reaches exactly zero, so it requires a
    non-zero salvage to converge in a finite number of periods. If the
    person leaves Salvage Value at 0 (a very common case), we use a
    notional 1% of cost as the *rate basis only* -- it is never written
    back to the Asset or shown as the real salvage value, it only shapes
    how fast the WDV rate declines the book value. This mirrors how most
    small-business accounting tools handle a zero-salvage WDV asset.

  - Monthly frequency pro-rates only the FIRST period, by calendar days
    from Available for Use Date (falling back to Purchase Date) to the
    end of that calendar month. Every subsequent period is a full
    calendar month. This means the schedule's last period lands slightly
    *after* the nominal life_years anniversary when the first period was
    partial -- which is correct: an asset placed in service mid-month
    finishes depreciating slightly later than one placed in service on
    the 1st, because the partial first month contributed less than a
    full month's depreciation.

  - Annually frequency is anchored to Available for Use Date /
    Purchase Date itself (each period is exactly one year later), not to
    a fiscal-year boundary. No pro-ration is needed there since every
    period is, by construction, a full year long. Fiscal-year-aligned
    annual depreciation (where the first "year" might be a stub period
    ending at fiscal year end) is a further refinement left for later --
    flagging rather than silently guessing at a fiscal year convention
    this app doesn't otherwise attach to Asset.

    any future "shrinks current_value mid-schedule" event tomorrow).

    Deliberately preserves period_no / depreciation_date / year /
    is_pro_rata exactly as originally generated -- i.e. it recomputes the
    remaining *amounts* against the new, smaller book value, but does not
    restart the calendar from the adjustment date. Two reasons:

      1. Completed rows are never touched (can't be -- their GL is
         already posted), so the only sane anchor for "what date is period
         N" is the schedule that was already built; restarting the clock
         would leave a gap or overlap around the adjustment date.
      2. The monthly engine's pro-ration only ever applies to the very
         first period of a schedule's life. An asset that's already mid
         schedule has no "first period" left to pro-rate -- every
         remaining row is already a full period -- so there is nothing
         calendar-shaped left to recompute, only the money.

    `pending_rows` must be in period order and contain only rows whose
    status is still Pending. Mutates each dict's opening_value /
    depreciation_amount / closing_value; other keys are left alone.
