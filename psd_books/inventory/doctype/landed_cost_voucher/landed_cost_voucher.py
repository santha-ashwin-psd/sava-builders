"""
Landed Cost Voucher — capitalizes freight/transport/other charges into item
valuation for a Purchase Receipt or Purchase Invoice that has already posted
its normal Stock Entry and GL entries.

Phase 1: data model — defaults, source-document validation, total roll-ups.
Phase 2 (via inventory/landed_cost_engine.py): proportional allocation of the
combined charge pool across item rows (by value or qty), populating
items[].allocated_amount and items[].new_valuation_rate on every save.
Phase 3 (on_submit/on_cancel below): writes one value-only Stock Ledger Entry
per item row (actual_qty=0, stock_value_difference=allocated_amount) so the
allocation actually lands on Bin.stock_value/valuation_rate — reusing
StockLedgerEntry._update_bin(), now extended (inventory/utils.
compute_bin_valuation) to handle that value-only case. Cancel reverses the
same way Stock Entry does: mark the original SLEs is_cancelled and insert
mirror entries with the sign flipped.
Phase 4 (this file, _post_gl_entries): on submit, Dr Inventory Asset for
total_charges / Cr each charge row's own account for its allocated amount —
via general_ledger_entry.make_gl_entries(), the same posting path Stock
Entry uses. Sized per charge row, not a lump sum, so each ledger stays
traceable back to its source (Landed Cost Charge.reference_doctype/
reference_name). Cancel calls make_gl_entries(..., cancel=True), which
reverses (not deletes) the entries — this also closes out the GL half of
Phase 6's cancel/amend handling.

Phase 5 (this file, _validate_no_duplicate_charge_capitalization / the rewritten
_create_valuation_sles / the rewritten _post_gl_entries): guardrails.
  - Blocks capitalizing the same sourced charge (Landed Cost Charge.
    reference_doctype/reference_name) through more than one submitted LCV —
    prevents the exact double-count the client flagged, without blocking
    legitimate multiple LCVs against the same PR/PI for genuinely different
    charges (e.g. a freight bill now, a customs duty bill later).
  - Replaces the old silent full-skip for partially-issued stock with a
    proportional capitalization: if only part of a row's received_qty is
    still on hand, only that fraction of its allocated charge is capitalized
    into Bin value; the rest is left in its original expense account rather
    than force-fit into inventory that no longer holds that qty. This mirrors
    ERPNext's own limitation (landed cost can't retroactively correct COGS
    already posted for issued stock) but makes it visible and *balanced*:
    total_capitalized_amount is tracked on the parent and on each item row,
    and _post_gl_entries scales every charge's GL credit by the same
    capitalized/total ratio so Dr Inventory always equals the sum of what
    was actually written to Bin.stock_value — no phantom value.
