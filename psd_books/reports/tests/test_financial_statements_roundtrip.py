"""
Round-trip consistency test across three financial statements (Balance
Sheet, Profit & Loss, Cash Flow Statement) driven by ONE synthetic set of
known transactions.

Rather than testing each report against arbitrary canned numbers, this
builds a single small ledger (capital injection, a sale with GST, the
customer payment, an asset purchase, a paid expense) and asserts identities
that must hold across the real accounting relationships:

  1. Balance Sheet balances: Total Assets == Total Liabilities + Equity
  2. Balance Sheet's "Net Profit (current period)" equity line == the P&L's
     own "Net Profit / Loss" total, computed independently from the same
     transactions
  3. Cash Flow's closing_cash == the Balance Sheet's actual Bank account
     balance as of the same date

This is the kind of bug none of the individual report unit tests would
catch on their own -- e.g. a sign error in one report's account-type
bucketing would make it internally consistent but disagree with the others.

DB-free: frappe.db.sql is a single global object, so within a test that
drives two reports we mock it ONCE and feed a single side_effect list in
the exact order the calls actually happen -- not one patch per report
module (that would just have the second patch silently clobber the first).
Every mocked return value is pre-aggregated BY HAND from the same
underlying transaction list (laid out below) rather than invented, so an
error in the by-hand aggregation would break the cross-report identities
just as a real bug would.

Run with:

        --module psd_books.reports.tests.test_financial_statements_roundtrip
