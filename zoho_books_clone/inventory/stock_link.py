"""
Stock Link — Audit fixes P2/Audit-2 and P2/Audit-3.

Wires Sales Invoice and Purchase Invoice on_submit events (via hooks.py)
to automatically create Stock Entries that keep inventory in sync with
invoicing.

  Audit-2: Sales Invoice submit  → Material Issue  (stock deducted)
           GL: DR COGS / CR Inventory (at valuation rate)
  Audit-3: Purchase Invoice submit → Material Receipt (stock added)
           GL: DR Inventory / CR Stock Received But Not Billed (GR/IR)
           The Purchase Invoice itself clears GR/IR (DR GRIR / CR AP) for
           stock items — see accounts.inventory_gl / post_purchase_invoice.

Return documents (Sales/Purchase Invoice with is_return=1) carry negative
qty and flip the physical direction: a Sales Invoice return restocks via a
Material Receipt (valued at current moving-average rate); a debit note
(Purchase Invoice is_return=1) de-stocks via a Material Issue (valued at the
original purchase rate). See _is_return_doc / _apply_current_valuation_rate.

If an item has no warehouse resolved, or is not a stock item, that row is
silently skipped so that non-inventory invoices continue to work.  If the
entire invoice has no stock items the hook returns without creating any entry.
