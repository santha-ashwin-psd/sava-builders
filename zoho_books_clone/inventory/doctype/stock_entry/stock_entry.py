        directly would erase the voucher while its stock/GL impact stays
        permanently baked into Bin and Account balances, with nothing left

        Once cancelled, on_cancel() has already reversed everything: the
        original SLE/GL rows are flagged is_cancelled=1 and mirror rows
        were posted alongside them, and every balance/report query filters
        `is_cancelled = 0`. So the leftover rows aren't contributing to any
        live balance — they exist purely as historical audit trail. Hard-
        deleting them here (instead of leaving them stranded forever) is
        what actually lets a wrongly-entered Item pass Item.on_trash()'s
        "does this item have any Stock Ledger Entry left" check afterward.
