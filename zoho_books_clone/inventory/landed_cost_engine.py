Landed Cost Voucher — allocation engine.

get_source_items      -- pull item rows from the referenced Purchase Receipt /
                          Purchase Invoice (resolving warehouse the same way
                          stock_link._stock_rows does: row > doc.set_warehouse
                          > item default > company default) into the plain
                          dict shape a Landed Cost Voucher Item row expects.
allocate_charges       -- pure function: given item rows (purchase_amount,
                          received_qty) and charge rows (amount), proportionally
                          distribute the combined charge pool across items by
                          value or by qty, and derive each item's new
                          valuation rate. No DB access — safe to unit test in
                          isolation and to call from LandedCostVoucher.validate().
get_landed_cost_preview -- whitelisted endpoint combining the two above, for
                          the frontend to render a live preview before submit.

None of this writes to Bin or posts GL entries — that's Phase 3 (valuation)
and Phase 4 (GL reclassification).
