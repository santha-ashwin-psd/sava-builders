"""
Custom role / module authorization — layered ON TOP of Frappe's permissions and
the multi-tenant company isolation in utils/tenancy.py.

Capability model:
  • Each gated doctype maps to a module (DOCTYPE_MODULE). A user can touch a
    doctype only if their `mod_<module>` flag is on (read & write).
  • "Books Viewer" is read-only everywhere — every write is blocked.
  • Accountant / Books Manager can read AND write within their granted modules.
  • Company admins (is_company_admin) and bypass roles (Administrator /
    System Manager) have full access.
  • Unmapped doctypes default to allowed, so lookups / non-sensitive doctypes
    never break. A doctype must be explicitly mapped to be gated.

The membership flags live on the "Books Company Member" doctype and are the same
ones surfaced to the SPA by api/session._get_membership.
