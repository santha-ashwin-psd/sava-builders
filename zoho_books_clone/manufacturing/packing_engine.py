Packing Engine — actions related to Packing Slips and Packing BOMs.

create_packing_slip       -- auto-generate a Packing Slip from a submitted
                             Work Order whose BOM is of type 'Packing'.
                             Pre-populates the items list from the Packing
                             BOM's packing_items table and the bulk_item row,
                             scaled to qty_to_pack. Also traces the bulk item
                             back to the Work Order that produced it
                             (source_work_order) and pre-fills the bulk row's
                             batch from that run, so packing is tied to a
                             specific production batch rather than "whatever's
                             in the warehouse".
get_packing_slips          -- list Packing Slips linked to a specific Work
                             Order (used by the WorkOrderView to show a
                             linked-doc count).
get_packing_slips_sourced_from_work_order
                            -- the inverse lookup: Packing Slips that consumed
                             a given (bulk-producing) Work Order's output,
                             via source_work_order.
post_packing_consumption   -- the Manufacture Stock Entry for a fully-packed
                             Packing Slip: consumes the bulk item + packing
                             materials from source_warehouse and receives the
                             packed item (batch-aware, same shelf-life/
                             autoname pattern as Work Order completion) into
                             target_warehouse. Without this, a Packing Slip
                             only tracked packed_qty on paper and never
                             touched the stock ledger. Also absorbs the
                             slip's Packing Operating Cost (labor/overhead)
                             into the packed item's valuation, the same way
                             Work Order completion absorbs Total Operating
                             Cost -- see Phase 5 notes below.
_check_stock_availability  -- Phase 3 guardrail: both create_packing_slip()
                             (best-effort, against Manufacturing Settings'
                             Default Source Warehouse, since the slip's own
                             source_warehouse isn't chosen yet) and
                             post_packing_consumption() (hard check, against
                             the slip's actual source_warehouse) check the
                             bulk item's and every packing material's real
                             Bin qty before proceeding, and throw one message
                             naming every short item -- instead of letting
                             Stock Entry's own negative-stock guard fail deep
                             in the call stack on just the first short row.
get_bulk_packing_reconciliation
                            -- Phase 6: for a bulk-producing Work Order, show
                             qty produced vs. qty consumed across every linked
                             Packing Slip (posted and reserved-but-unposted
                             separately) vs. qty still sitting in the
                             warehouse, with a batch-level breakdown when the
                             bulk item is batch-tracked -- so shortages or
                             overpacking are visible at a glance instead of
                             only discoverable by chasing Stock Ledger Entries.
list_bulk_packing_reconciliations
                            -- Phase 6b: the fleet-wide version -- reconciles
                             every bulk-producing Work Order in a date range
                             (optionally filtered by status/company) and
                             returns them worst-first, so shortages surface
                             without opening each Work Order one at a time.
