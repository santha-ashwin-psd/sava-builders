"""
Production Plan (MRP) transactional actions.

Doctype-agnostic create/save/submit/cancel/amend/list of Production Plan
itself is handled by api/docs.py's generic endpoints — this module only holds
the bespoke logic specific to running MRP:

  get_open_sales_orders     -- list Sales Orders that still have undelivered
                                qty, for the demand picker on the Production
                                Plan form.
  get_items_from_sales_orders
                             -- given a list of selected Sales Order names,
                                aggregate pending (qty - delivered_qty) per
                                item across all of them and resolve each
                                item's default submitted BOM, so the
                                Items-to-Manufacture table can be
                                populated/refreshed client-side.
  get_raw_materials          -- explode the BOM for every row in
                                Items-to-Manufacture (reusing the same
                                ratio logic as work_order_engine.get_bom_breakdown),
                                aggregate raw-material qty across all rows,
                                and compare against on-hand stock in the
                                plan's default source warehouse.
  create_work_orders         -- bulk-generate one Draft Work Order per
                                Items-to-Manufacture row (for whatever
                                planned qty doesn't already have a Work
                                Order), tagging each with this Production
                                Plan for traceability. Work Orders are left
                                in Draft so a person can review/adjust
                                before submitting — this endpoint doesn't
                                submit them.
