"""
Work Order transactional actions.

Everything doctype-agnostic (create/save/submit/cancel/amend/list Work Order
itself) is already handled by api/docs.py's generic endpoints — this module
only holds the bespoke logic that's specific to running a Work Order:

  get_default_bom_for_item -- resolve which BOM a new Work Order should
                          default to for a given Production Item (Item's
                          default_bom, falling back to any active submitted
                          BOM for that item), so the Work Order form can
                          auto-fill the BOM field on item selection.
  get_bom_breakdown   -- preview raw materials & operations from a BOM at a
                          given qty, so the Work Order form can populate/
                          refresh its child tables client-side before save.
  issue_materials      -- Material Transfer of raw materials into the WIP
                          warehouse (only relevant if a WIP warehouse is set).
  complete_work_order  -- the Manufacture Stock Entry: consumes raw
                          materials, receives the finished item (batch-aware,
                          reuses Batch's shelf-life auto-calc & auto-naming),
                          and posts recoverable scrap/by-products. Being a
                          plain "Manufacture" Stock Entry, it automatically
                          passes through the existing QC gate
                          (auto_create_qc_for_stock_entry) if the finished
                          item requires inspection — no bespoke QC wiring
                          needed here.
